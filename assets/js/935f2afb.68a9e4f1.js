At the LHC, top quarks are primarily produced in quark\u2013antiquark pairs (tt), and due to its large production cross section ( around 830 pb at 13 TeV), the LHC can be viewed as \\"a top-quark factory\\".

Despite the small branching ratio, a reasonably large signal yield can be obtained thanks to the high photon reconstruction and identification efficiency at the ATLAS experiment.
